# homebridge-hive-lightbulb

This [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) Plugin will provide support for the Hive Active Heating lightbulbs to be controlled in the Home app in iOS and via Siri.

I am aiming to publish this module by the end of September 2017.# homebridge-hive-lightbulb
